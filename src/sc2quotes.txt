The Firstborn shall persevere.
Glory to the Daelaam.
I have met the enemy!
Glorious combat is upon us!
Combat awaits.
Aiur shall be reclaimed.
Give us your command.
Yes, Executor?
Na ja'kar mena.
Where shall we march?
Let your will be heard.
Faith before fear.
Forward.
The Templar march.
Let none deter us.
We are of one mind.
Por zalah.
To glory.
I am the will of the Hierarch.
Glaive cannon armed.
May your death be swift.
Eradication.
Victory for the Firstborn!
For Selendis!
To glorious battle.
Spare none who oppose us.
We are the stewards of the hierarchy.
Aiur will be reclaimed at any cost.
Some Templar identify as a shield. Stalwart and unbreakable, defenders of truth.
Others see themselves as a weapon. Powerful and precise.
I say, why not be both?
With the right training, anyone can be in two places at once. But their mind must be fully open. Oh, and they need a psionic amplifier. That helps too.
Chasing after your own shade is a pointless endeavor. I mean, it moves so quickly.
Why yes, you could say I have...some, skill. (chuckles)
What? Just because I'm called an adept doesn't mean I have to brag about it.
I'm here. (sound effect). I'm there. (sound effect). I'm...still here. At least for a few more seconds.
The merging is complete.
Dispersing.
What guidance?
We...BURN!
Power overwhelming!
We NEED focus!
Destroy.
Annihilate.
Obliterate.
Eradicate.
It will be.
Mok tar'idan.
Dominate.
Decimate.
Vaporize.
You all look so different on this side...
Break on through!
It's beautiful!
They should have sent a poet!
Energy never dies...
I'm having a FLARE UP!
One plus one equals...ONE!
People say I lack...substance.
I'm... LIT!
Burning... doing.... the neutron... DANCE...
Carrier has arrived!
We are in peril!
We have met the enemy!
Uhn anak paru.
We are ready.
We are poised for victory.
Let us proceed.
Awaiting the call.
Victory awaits!
The time is now.
Zhara ku'nuul.
To victory!
Na hazuum.
Agreed.
Prepare to engage.
The Khala is served!
Justice is served! 
The battle is won.
Engaging the enemy!
Boh aradahn!
Obliterate.
Oblivion descends!
Let us finish this!
The end has come!
Tassadar be praised!
I carry on...
This ship strikes as the spear of justice!
My patience is limitless...(quietly)...release the interceptors!
Our fleet shall avenge Aiur!
The stars are under our protection.
Our light shall shine through the Void.
From the shadows I come!
I...cannot maintain!
Battle is upon us! 
What would you ask of us?
You seek our service?
Nas beru uhn'adarr?
I bask in the twilight.
Fear is an illusion...
The darkness writhes.
Zhakul inok.
I will comply.
By the Void.
Clever.
Khatum
I am intrigued.
I am but a phantom.
I am the blade of Shakuras.
I am the blade of the Nerazim 
Darkness descends!
I strike from the shadows!
Alakor de zhakan!
The void claims its own.
They shall fall!
I am the darkness!
By the shadows of Shakuras...
By the shadows... 
Twilight falls upon us all!
The shadows writhe around me...
I stalk the night.
Raszagal, watch over us...
I hear an ancient voice, whispering from the Void, and it chills my lightless heart...
I live on.
Consciousness awakened.
Our foes surround us.
Presiding.
Ancient glory reborn.
We begin anew.
Your demands?
Speak and be heard.
Obedience.
I comprehend.
With honor.
It is known.
Darai de khassar.
Eternal service.
So be it.
Veritably.
The Firstborn will triupmh!
Overloading.
Purification.
A demonstration?
Calibrating attack pattern.
Life as an artificial intelligence is really not so bad. You might even say it's 'all-in'.
I am completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly. Why would you suspect otherwise?
Ow. Why was I programmed to feel pain?
I was designed to be a pacifist. But I will admit, when I get charged up, I've been known to explode.
I will listen, and be patient.
I will receive your wisdom.
Do you even possess wisdom?
I thought I would be surrounded by the best and brightest if I became a purifier. Instead, the future is full of idiots.
Is this how the Templar treat all robotic lifeforms? You would do well to remember, we will outlive you. And we do not forget.
(Computer sound). Warning, memory matrix corrupted. Reboot in progress. (Computer sound, followed by new voice tone and punctuated speech); Greetings, Executor. I am your new disruptor. I look forward to learning from you.
Khassar de Templari!
We cannot hold!
We are the light of the Khala!
We seek enlightenment.
Our minds are as one.
Uhn ore'ki atum.
We shall stand against the darkness.
My charge?
We are focused.
En Taro Tassadar.
I heed the call.
Thus I serve.
I will comply.
O'lak natahl.
We are unanimous.
With unity, there is strength.
We shall not falter.
The true enemy is dishonor.
Duty is my shield.
Rautha sak ash.
For Aiur!
We will overcome!
Together we vanquish!
Focus! There is no time for idle thoughts!
Your thoughts betray you.
Get out of my mind, novice! There is a war to be won!
You tempt the wrath of the Khala!
Pity! Your mind has been fried already.
Yours is the inferior intellect!
I think we could make a successful merger.
Ride the lightning!
Do you know what happens to a frog when it gets hit by lightning?!
Same thing that happens to...(pause)... other stuff.
Saraht tuun!
Two become one!
I falter! 
Khassar de Templari!
Our foe strikes!
We shall endure
Wisdom though adversity.
Our spirit is indomitable.
We are focused once more.
Our power shall serve.
The darkness will be repelled.
Your thoughts are clear.
En Taro Tassadar.
I heed the call.
As ever I serve.
I will comply.
O'lak natahl.
We continue on.
Unity through purpose.
As ever I serve.
For Artanis.
We shall not falter.
The true enemy is dishonor.
Duty is my shield.
Rautha sak ash.
For Aiur!
We will overcome!
Together we vanquish!
Our power is from within
Suffer as we have
With the Khala fallen to corruption, the memories of our ancestors are lost to us.
For the first time, the halls of the Templar archives are silent.
It has been difficult to bear
Without the Khala to rely on, our power has been difficult to control, but not impossible.
Your thoughts are growing harder to read. It seems my strength has not fully returned.
Let me try something. You’re feeling… happy! No… sad. No, wait… Happy! Agh, how do the Dark Templar deal with this?
*sigh* I don’t even know how I feel anymore.
I’m sorry. Our situation is difficult. I lack even the will to make lightning puns. Shocking, I know. Oh, I did it!
Saraht tuun! 
Two become one!
I falter! 
I return to serve.
The enemy closes.
I feel your presence.
I hear the call.
Our duty is eternal.
Uhn dara ma'nakai.
O sharas shi'el.
Glory is eternal.
Our duty is unending.
We shall serve forever!
It is destined.
Ik sha'bi.
Khala dora.
There shall be a reckoning.
Our cannons shall sing.
We march to victory.
For the ancients!
The battle is ours!
En Taro Adun!
Let darkness be parted.
Woe to our enemies.
Fury unyielding!
Naku zail.
I am the wrath of the Khala!
These steel limbs are not my own.
I have known only an eternity of war.
My memory is not what it was...
There can be only one!
Back in my day, I had to teleport to and from school in the snow, uphill, both dimensions![1]
Youth is WASTED on the young!
Where's my walker?! (pause) Oh...I'm in it...
The second thing to go is your memory...ergh, I can't remember what the first thing is...
Justice has come!
Defensive systems failing.
Breach in progress! We are undone!
As all are one.

We are the voice of Aiur.
Our systems pulse with the truth.
Our light shall burn the pathway to the stars.
The glow of the infinite is within us.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
Shuffleboard on the lido deck, now commencing.
Eat your peas!
Don't MAKE me turn this ship around!
There are not enough escape pods, not enough by half...
Teleport successful.
They've broken through.
Engaging the enemy. 
Time for battle.
Warp field online.
The skies await.
Zira'vek kryor!
Where do our enemies lurk?
I am eager to strike!
Anan pokahl!
On the wings of justice!
Sha'zu du templari!
For honor!
Understood.
I will stalk through the starts.
I will comply.
Na ferash.
I soar to victory.
Weapons primed.
Ruwak khador!
None shall escape.
I will prevail.
Strike!
Our dominance is unquestioned!
We shall rise from the ashes.
I long for the skies of Aiur.
Our fury shall be unleashed.
Valor is my shield.
I have a lot of nerve...cords...
Transmute...
Second star on the right, straight on 'til morning.
We push ourselves to the end, and when we reach it, we push farther! So I guess that's not really the end...is it?
Justice for all! (Except the zerg.)
We stalk through the stars.
Disperse. 
Disruption commencing. 
I am here in the shadows.
Fall back to the shadows!
Let our enemy know our fury. 
State thy bidding.
I am the voice of the eclipse.
You require my skills?
I am the heart of darkness.
Cold is the Void...
We are one with the shadows.
Intriguing...
Very wise.
I serve... for now.
Very well.
Veraku.
We move unseen.
For the reckoning!
It shall be as you say.
Forever sleep!
Complete the cycle!
The Void hungers!
Cold fury!
Antu'kha.
For Shakuras!
Death comes to all!
Doom'ha du nala!
My heart is colder than these steel limbs...
We are all but shadows in the Void.
I hear the call of the stars...
Twilight comes... As it must.
Night falls...and so will you!
I AM ONE with the darkness!
(crashing sound, then softly) Ouch...that hurt...
You look better in the dark!
Don't Blink...or you'll miss me!
Now you see me. Now you don't! (pause) Oh wait, here I am...
You went to bed early last night.
I see you turned off your phone.
You never return my calls.
I'm your biggest fan!
Restraining order... what about our love?!
I have pictures of you... hundreds!
Prismatic core online.
Peradak kural.
Prismatic core failing; we require assistance!
We face the enemy. 
Channel the light of Aiur!
Phase crystals charged.
We are at full power.
This vessel shall avenge.

All paths are seen through the prism of fate.
Conflict must not be seen through the lenses of desperation.
Our wills are aligned through the holy Khala!
United in purpose, we serve the Daelaam. 
Infinity burns around us.
There is no greater void than the one between your ears...
I am also null...
Always bet on Void...
Oracle perceiving.
Dimensional strings attuned.
The enemy has discovered us.
The threads of fate lie bare.
Our window is short.
You seek guidance?
How can I aid you?
En aru'din Raszagal.
An omen?
We are the architects of fate.
It is destined.
Extrapolating strings.
We interpret.
Harmonized.
I see.
The stars align.
Na zuktai.
Our fates are one.
Hold on, I broke a string.
Let us peer into possible futures...reply hazy, try again.
Always in motion is the future. Difficult to see.
I see someone important to you is in danger. Their name begins with a g...no, maybe a b?
Sparta must not go to war during Carnea...oh, sorry, a little late on that one.
No man should know too much about his own destiny. It's completely fine for women though.
You wish to do battle? (Entomb sound effect) I don't think you've got the minerals!
Time is on my side. Yes, it is.
No, you cannot see my software.
We meet our fate. 
Kinetic matrix active.
Direct my vengeance.
We meet the enemy in glorious battle!
Hull integrity failing!
Our charge?
We seek justice.
Victory is in our grasp.
Vengeance is ours.
We fear no enemy.
The Golden Armada awaits.
Na urmahk Aiur.
Por zalah!
Forward to victory.
Throw fate to the winds.
For glory!
Confirmed.
A storm is brewing.
Kinetic matrix charged.
Feel our fury!
We are the spear of justice
Directing overload.
Your end has come.
Victory is assured.
Strike without warning.
Aradal zu mah.
This vessel was not designed for social interaction!
You are...irritating.
I can't hear you over the sound of the storm.
What exactly is a jigawatt?
Goodness gracious great balls of lightning.
It's not the voltage that kills. It's the big explosion afterwards.
I have no mouth, and I must scream.
Never strike twice unless it's still moving.
Carrier? I hardly know her!
We will pursue our enemies across the stars.
My life for Aiur!
We cannot hold!
We embrace the glory of battle! 
My meditation is over.
We stand as one!
We are the blades of Aiur!
Command me.
Orin shis'nal!
Justice be done!
Na Adan Atum!
En Taro Tassadar!
By your will!
For Artanis!
Ul'as addari!
Khassar de templari!
Honor guide me!
Our fury is boundless!
Blades of justice!
None shall stand!
Aru nal'adan!
It must be done!
None can withstand the Templar!
I am Templar! I am the sword of truth!
Combat is the anvil of will!
Our enemies must be eradicated!
Victory is the only truth that matters!
How peaceful it must be for you to have a mind unburdened by thought!
Fear is for the enemy!
Do NOT make me count to Zmidlarj!
It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
Victory is what lies ahead!
We stand unified!
Na adan Daelaam.
Adun toridas.
Our foes grow bold.
Neraz gulio.
Yes?
I'm waiting...
Zerashk gulida!
I fight on.
The fallen still serve.
You call upon me?
For Aiur.
Ner'mah.
So be it.
Very well.
In the name of the many...
As the shadow wills.
Our triumph is at hand.
Boldly.
No trace shall remain.
Annihilation.
Darkness envelops.
Fury of the Void!
Ah, our thoughts align.
Embrace oblivion.
As it must be.
In this desperate hour, all who are able to serve must do so... Even those, who have fallen.
Identify our foe, and it shall be annihilated.
I must warn you, your taunts are ill-advised, Templar.
I once fought for the liberation of Shakuras against the Zerg Swarm itself. I do not have sit idly and accept this abuse.
Do not force me to emerge from this walker and teach you a lesson.
Enough! *struggles a bit* Someone tell me how to get out of this thing!
*frustrated exertion* You are quite fortunate these tubes are difficult to remove.
Warp field stabilized.
This vessel is under assault.
We feel your presence.
Durahs.
Dun-a duhn.
Lead the way.
We remain vigilant.
Chronometrics steady.
We serve the Daelaam.
Our expertise is yours.
J'takha zohl.
Establishing vector.
Daugh-ron.
Spatial coordinates received.
We shall lend our power.
As the Hierarch wills.
Let it be so.
Phase disruptors primed.
Sal'orin khador.
Space-time coordinates locked.
We proceed.
Judgement.
Let our enemies fall.
We strike from the skies.
Ah, another soul in search of answers.
We judicators are eternally grateful that our Hierarch has allowed us to serve Aiur once more.
And yet, you Templar are still wary of our actions. Our desire to fight for our homeworld is equal to any other.
You seek a lesson in time travel? Very well.
To understand time you must first conceive it. Think of a flat circle. Now, imagine twenty five million circles intersecting that circle at different points from the center.
This is not a hard thing, Templar. Younglings are taught this exercise...
(resigned) Perhaps we should begin again. *SFX: Rewinding of the past few lines replaying like a tape deck and then replaying You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.*
Vengeance for the betrayed.
You dare to challenge me?
Ask, I may listen.
Action is the only course.
May the terrazine flow.
The talons of Slayn listen.
Remember your place.
Alakor nir shozak.
I heed, because Alarak wills it.
Acceptable.
As the chain commands.
Ascension.
Na adan korikas.
Until I choose otherwise.
Ul'as savir.
I concur.
Grovel, you worm!
Your agony begins.
By blood and fury.
Unmiltigated chaos.
I shall ascend.
Thus I conquer.
Woe to the slain.
We are bound by the chain of ascension.
But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
Ow, I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.
Vengeance for Aiur.
May this battle bring us glory!
We will atone.
There is no solace in exile.
Give your order.
Retribution awaits.
Our day will come.
Aiur shall rise anew.
Glory through perseverance.
With pride!
As you say.
So shall it be.
We obey.
En aras addari.
Our light lives on.
Eternally.
Our revenge is at hand!
Templari por Aiur!
Justice will reign.
Death to the enemies of the Firstborn!
We are steadfast.
For the Hierarch!
I serve the Firstborn.
Our fate lies with our homeland.
Many of our people have fallen... but their deaths will not be in vain.
The enemy has changed, and so must we.
I imagine that Adun never thought he'd see someone like me.
What do you call an Aiur protoss who can meld with the shadows? Hm... Overpowered!
I am but ONE avenger. Please, do not refer to us in the plural form..
I seek the unworthy.
I shall relish this battle!
Ah, the scent of fear.
I sense... weakness. Frailty.
Where does my prey hide?
My search goes on.
I yearn for slaughter.
Blood will be spilled.
If you are certain.
As you will it.
With pleasure.
Yes?
Viras Rakan!
Skosal vin'shir.
I hunt.
It shall be so.
My blade thirsts.
Death is a gift.
They will be purged.
The culling begins.
Executing.
Nothing will remain...
I stalk the weak.
You have disappointments... I have solutions.
Only warriors deserve the honor of fair combat. I eliminate the rest.
They are always too foolish to sense my presence... until it's too late.
The frail must die so the strong can thrive. Such is the way of Rak'shir... such is the way of the Tal'darim.
You may find our ways harsh, templar. But it is better to be harsh than pathetic.
Does your Hierarch listen to you? Because I don't.
I walk the shadowed path.
Our blades meet the enemy!
The Shadow Guard waits.
Give us your command.
We stand watch.
Na Adan Shaios!
Ever vigilant.
We await our charge.
None shall break us.
So be it.
Your command is law.
For Vorazun!
The guard moves.
We shall shield this world.
Eternally resolute.
The shadow descends.
Break before us!
Your end has come!
Zerashk Gulida.
Face the endless void!
Let our blades strike true!
As fate decrees.
I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight!
Our duty is bound to the matriarch's will!
We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim!
Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred centurions! Never more, never less, unless one falls in battle. And yet we replace them quickly!
What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us really bend it to our will!
From time to time, we fashion armor from the bones of our prey! It is a grand tradition reminding us how far we have come! No, we do not have jaw envy.
The templar zealots will not admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning. (chuckles)
It is a good day to die.
The battle begins.
Ready for battle.
I stand ready.
Let us attack!
May I be of service?
Honor through Valor.
The skies beckon.
Adun Toridas.
Adun Toridas!
Ah, at last!
I thought you'd see it my way.
Eyes to the horizon.
Joh'gaav!
The sky is my battlefield.
I shall be swift.
Hold nothing back!
I have but one life to give!
Let me die honorable.
By the grace of Aiur.
Zhakul gulida.
They shall be disrupted.
My fight to the end.
I have but one life to give!
These skies are mine!
Look at all the pretty lights!
I wonder what this button does. [Alarm beeps]
I think this was a BIG mistake.
...you might even say... a HUGE mistake.
If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
I must stop starring at the sun.
Corners like it's on rails.
I feel the need... the need for... AN EJECTOR SEAT! LOOK OUT!
We are as one...
Conflict arises.
Must have energy...
We hear you...
Thoughts in chaos...
Must feed...
Energy...
Your will... is ours...
We roil.
Will go...
Oblivion awaits...
We move...
*ghostly moan*
As you say...
Energy... Need energy!
The Void burns...
Wrath...
Your energy is ours...
Consume.
Darkness overpowering!
Feeble minds...
Unending torment.
Smolder...
Aldaris... Betrayer, betrayed.
We live... in times of great need...
Once you go Dark Archon... you never come back...
Do not tempt us... Your mind is not as strong as you think.
Ulrezaj lives on... We feel his rage.
The Void... filled with hatred... it mirrors our own.
Our existence... is suffering... do not prolong it.
We are as one 
The Death Fleet descends.
Let destruction commence.
Only destruction awaits our foes.
I am the ember of eternity.
Destruction awaits all traitors.
Karaz arak shizol.
Give me purpose.
Your foes shall burn.
Speak your command.
The time has come.
Betrayal is death.
Your will, imposed.
Ash and cinder.
Understood.
Seek and destroy.
Not long now.
Extermination shall come.
Rik'kan virok.
Bloodshards aligning.
Unleash the consuming flame!
A tide of fire and blood.
Destruction is at hand.
Vok'az Shirol.
Unto fate.
*excited* Oh, yes.
Gladly.
The will of the Tal'Darim.
Creation is meaningless, even a mindless organism can create.
Destruction, hovewer... one's will imposed upon the universe, that is true expression.
The flames of Alarak's wrath will purge this universe of Amon's worshippers. And I shall be the instrument of their destruction.
I feel like destroying something beautiful. To be fair, I always feel this way.
This vessel has as much in common with a void ray as a spear does with a twig.
Show me your foes. And I shall destroy them! Burn them to ash! And then, I'll destroy the ash. *evil laugh*
The Nerazim have constructed an Annihilator? Perhaps we have more in common than we think.
I yearn to fly through the darkened skies of Slayn. And then DESTROY them.

I pledged my life to the Templar... What have you done?
Ask not what your robotic warrior can do for you, but what you can do for your robotic warrior.
What can you do for me? Well. I would like some weapons upgrades.
And... perhaps some high capacity power fluctuators...
Hm, that new trillic compression mesh looks very imposing, does it not?
And would a fresh coat of paint be too much to add? It has been millennia, after all.
It takes a lot of work to look this good after thousands of years.
You seek our aid.
Locking on target!
We hold the power of the past.
Valor is eternal.
What is our charge?
We overcome.
Salu'kim ti alati.
There is no greater glory than battle.
We seek honor through duty.
We accept.
As it was, in the days of old...
We stand with the Firstborn.
Consider it done.

The Purifiers will retake the rightful place among the Templars.
Your hierarch is unlike judicators we have known, he is a bright spark in the series of shadows.
We protoss have many ways of surviving brutalities of battle, but only the way the Purifiers ensures eternal life.
I do wish I had considered the Conclave's preconceived notions about robotic intelligence before joining the Purifier program.

Guide my blade.
The enemy shall be purified.
I stand ready.
Speak your demands.
Command me.
Identify our foe.
Ul'as addari.
Protocols aligned.
With honor.
My blade yearns to meet our foe.
For Fenix!
Khassar de templari!
Executing!
As the Hierarch wills.
Know the might of the Templar!
We are the overwhelming tide.
Your purification is at hand!
To glorious battle!
Be undone!
I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar.
When I get knocked, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
Releasing consciousness.
For Aiur!
Embracing battle.
I wait.
Thura shis'al.
Command me.
Seek justice.
I serve.
(sigh) For unity!
I'm summoned.
With honor.
En taro Tassadar.
Your will.
Adai.
Khessar.
It shall be...
Chaos.
I protect!
Guarding.
Sacred land!
Aiur's foes, burn!
For the firstborn!
None withstand!
As one.
(Ugh). I'm called
Protect Aiur.
I see You...
For homeworld!
Never rest!
Blades ready!
Unending duty!
Victory has come.
Commencing bloodshed.
You presume to speak?
Impress me.
This had better be worthwhile.
I will not suffer fools.
Fealty unto the Highlord.
We are the soul of strength.
My will is iron.
A fine scheme.
We are in agreement... this time.
So long as it leads to glory.
By our birthright.
I shall indulge.
A worthy order.
Rik'kan thok ishar.
Ascension through battle!
They shall flee before me!
For the Tal'darim.
They shall die most painfully.
My triumph awaits.
No one stands against me.
Vok'az Shirol!
Weakness is a path to death.
The Templar have words... The Tal'darim have blades!
Before we became the Chosen, we were the Forged. And we can never be broken.
We do not waste time with engineering and manufacture. The weak provide our weapons and our ships.
Piloting a ship is no more complicated than wielding a blade. I know what every panel in this vessel does! Except... this one.
*button pressing sound* WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
*beeping sound* No! Cease that infernal noise! Do not make me turn this ship around!
*beeping sound* Arrgh! Be silent! *smashing sound, then all is quiet*
There. Now for you... I may not be your real mothership, but you still have to obey me!
The hour is upon us.
The fires of conflict burn bright.
We are reforged.
I will serve.
Unto death.
Ever atoning.
Sko'rishar vinok.
Grant me my end.
Order me to war.
I am the first line.
Willingly.
So shall I suffer.
As fate decrees.
For the Highlord.
As the chain commands.
I obey.
Unquestioned.
We advance.
Conflict is my penance.
Absolution.
Purging fire!
Viras Rakan!
My fate is bound.
I am unleashed.
Our foes shall be scattered.
Even broken links can be made to serve the chain of ascension.
I am the last link in the chain of ascension. I am a Vanguard, and only my death shall have meaning.
Forgiveness is a Templar virtue. I seek only for my failures to be forgotten.
We are the first to battle, and if fate smiles upon us, we shall never return.
You Templar refer to your assault striders as Immortals Our cultures are quite different, indeed.
To think of the trouble the Tal'darim have caused the Templar. Be thankful you never encountered the Venti'darim.
I tire, and my thoughts darken. Leave me to them.
My transgressions... forgotten.
I am but memory.
The hour of my vengeance has come.
My blades have met the enemy.
Speak, now!
You address the highlord?
How shall you serve me?
What?
Do not waste my time.
Of course I am needed.
State your request.
Only because I will it.
As I desire.
So shall it be.
Oh, well, I agree with this choice.
So goes the Chain of Ascension.
As I will it.
Oblivion awaits.
Oh, they shall suffer.
My blades seek blood.
Krishol'fak Aram.
The weak always fall.
Vengeance is mine.
Burn!
Ugh, my patience runs short, Templar. Do not press me further.
*scoff* Are you capable of listening, or just comprehending?
So this is the zerg, the great enemy who brought the Templar so low? How utterly disappointing.
Bow to your highlord and submit completely to my rule! Really!
Oh, hierarch, is this how you spend your free time? No wonder these missions of yours take so very, very long.
There are fates worse than death you know.
I could have you extract terrazine until you lose your mind like that fool, Nyon.
(sounding intoxicated) ahhh, *sniffs* oh, the breath of creation fuels my every...uh, what was I... what was I saying?
I'm hungry. Ugh, maybe I got it all wrong.
Maybe I should show a little compassion.
Maybe Amon is just misunderstood. Maybe, maybe we both are.
My wrath is not quenched.
We must stand as one.
Stand with me!
We shall prevail.
Strength in unity.
Faith before fear.
Dawn will come.
Harak en vaiash.
Our thoughts are one!
Our path is clear.
There can be no doubt!
March boldly, without fear.
Shakhal zenn!
Adun, guide my hand.
Vanquish!
Triumph through sacrifice.
They will meet justice.
You would spread discord among us?!
I am gravely disappointed in you.
I must practice tolerance.
I am not easily provoked.
Die! Die! DIE!
Has it all been for nothing...? 
Kerrigan...how could we have known?!
We must stand as one.
Stand with me!
Dawn will come.
We shall prevail.
Our destiny awaits.
Strength in unity.
Harak en vaiash.
Change is upon us
I serve my people.
A bold plan
Our path is clear.
There can be no doubt!
Together we are strong.
Our thoughts are one!
With honor I lead.
The future is ours.
Vanquish!
Shakhal zenn!
En Taro, Zeratul.
Adun, guide my hand.
Triumph through sacrifice.
They will meet justice.
We fight against the darkness.
This duty is mine.
I will bring unity to the firstborn
We shall forge a new peace
I might be Hierarch, yes, but that does not mean I enjoy speaking at great length
You are quite insistent, aren't you. Perhaps you are part Tal'darim.
When I was a Templar, I could solve problems with a psi blade... if you take my meaning.
Adun; Tassadar; Zeratul. All of my mentors met an early end.
Perhaps the cost of greatness is too high.
Have you ever said my name backwards? There is a strange.. music to it
I stand ready
I am engaging our foe
Yes, Hierarch?
My expertise is yours.
What may I resolve?
I will find the solution.
I hear you.
We are all Templar.
Amon shall not prevail.
Naku afal Auir.
A phase-smith is always prepared.
It will be.
I concur.
We are united.
The psi-matrix will fall.
Progress is made by the bold.
Shalala arai Daelaam.
Purpose guides us.
Auir will be restored.
Strike now!
The opportune moment has come.
Together we cannot be matched.
We cannot fail now.
Witness the power of a phase-smith.
Templari paru.
Isa atu.
Foes beware.
The task ahead is difficult, but worthwhile
I see the grand design behind it all; the intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
These psionic storms are growing worse.
Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
I hope my drones are doing all right up there.
It's only been a short while since we returned to Auir and had to flee from it, yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
The Khalai long served the Firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams, and now we are all equal.
I am a phase-smith, and I am a Templar.
Fenix was right. It is indeed a glorious day.
I die a Templar.
I am honored to serve.
Reinforce our position!
What is your will?
Awaiting your command.
Direct my efforts.
Gon su'ruu.
The Khala illuminates my path.
It is a privilege.
I share your aim.
I will oblige.
As you intend.
We shall surpass them.
Our cause is just.
For our fallen brethren.
O'naron il'aroj.
Our people need us!
You know nothing of honor.
You are a stain within the Khala!
I have a somewhat unfavorable premonition about this.
Urgh. I wish I could not read your mind.
Forgive...my...failure. 
Now...I will become one...with the Khala. 
The Void will answer.
Our enemies are bound.
My mind is my own.
Orin ore'kal arash.
Hold to your will.
We linger in twilight.
You understand little.
Let your thoughts be free.
It will be done.
We press forth.
They restore the balance.
O'na zhakan en zhakul.
The darkness yearns.
I am a shadow in darkness.
The centuries have taught me patience.
Empty minds are easily broken.
Some humans have redeeming qualities. You are not one of them.
The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.
Hello darkness, my old friend.
Remember the khalaraj.
I am now... beyond you.
I return...to the void. 
I will restore order.
Assist your commander!
This is the executor.
Our glory will be renewed.
Victory against all odds.
Justice is due.
A sound plan.
Umora sha'is!.
Precisely.
It is time to act.
Destiny commands us!
Prove your valor.
Death to the enemies of Aiur.
Do not hesitate.
Aram fa'sha!.
Insolence will not be tolerated.
My attention is needed elsewhere.
I am surrounded by inferior life forms.
A noble end... 
Forgive me, great Tassadar. I wasn't...strong enough. 
Let it begin!
Assist me!
We tarry too long.
Complacency threatens!
The final hour is upon us.
Our suffering must end!
With pride.
A worthy order.
Satisfactory.
As you say.
Al umidor.
They will pay in blood.
No turning back!
Show no weakness!
Vengeance is overdue.
Il mara darash.
We must fight while we still have the strength!
Have you forgotten Aiur?!
Who are you, and why should I care?
Enough of this nonsense!
May the zerg take you.
Thus it ends...
There is just...too many of them.
Show me my enemy!
Come brothers, join me in glorious battle!
Hierarch?
Your command?
What would you ask of me?
I hunger for battle...
Speak and you will be heard
En taro Adun
I am the blade of Artanis
Isa atu!
For Aiur!
Immediately!
Nahda gahla!
As you will!
Your will made manifest.
None shall impede me.
Honor guide me!
Without hesitation
To battle
For the glory of the Daelaam!
Let our foes be purified!
Death to all opposition!
Thus I serve!
For Adun!
Let my blades strike true!
On this battlefield I seek only glorious combat. We need not speak, Hierarch, our blades shall speak for us.
What is it you seek, my friend?
It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.
As he tore through his enemies, Fenix would repeat to himself a code he lived by. That reminded him why he fought
I fear no enemy. For the Khala is my strength.
I fear not death. For our strength is eternal.
May his deeds be remembered forever, and his death never forgotten.
Unto death, i serve
The Nerazim will answer.
I strike at our foe!
Yes?
What is your will
I walk the shadowed path.
Nas beru s'adarr?
We must form a plan.
You require counsel?
There is little time
En aru'din Shakuras.
We stand with our allies.
Our future is the Daelaam.
Neraz gulio.
It is my honor.
There is much to be done.
The path to victory awaits!
For our homeland!
Zhakan s'ak-ash!
The shadows are my shield!
Twilight enshrouds me.
This shall be our day of triumph.
Zhakul gulida!
Together, we shall ensure the future of our people.
Our blades burn brightest in dark times.
This is the greatest battle we could ever hope to win.
I am Matriarch of the Nerazim. We have sheltered our brethren from Aiur, yet our differences persist.
I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
Not that we would enjoy watching you try.
But... this is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.
Our legacy lives on...
I will do all that must be done.
All is in jeopardy!
The mission is in peril!
Disaster is imminent!
My enemies close in! 
I face a new trial
You address me?
I will erase the demons of the past.
My burdens weigh heavily.
I will be redeemed.
Shozak mok nul?
We must not hesitate.
En aru'din Raszagal.
Aiur will be restored.
Glory to the Firstborn.
Honor commands.
We must not hesitate!
Sok'dash salahk.
My allegiance is yours.
I will find hope for my people 
I seek the path of salvation 
I bring wisdom in times of chaos 
I shall find a way. 
Glory to the Daelaam. 
The prophecy guides us. 
There is much to answer for.
Oblivion descends!
Aru nal'adan!
The scales will be balanced.
We must act!
I will not rest until my atonement is complete.
I press on with renewed purpose.
I will not falter. I will not waver.
Our enemies will be undone.
Through the darkest night, we await the coming of the dawn.
I must not allow my guilt to consume me. I will find a way to set things right.
Retribution will be swift and absolute.
Hesitation leads to defeat.
Only the truth can lead us 
The Xel'naga have given us the keys to our future 
We must be ever watching - ever vigilant 
I suspect vigilance is one of your... weaker attributes 
Kindly leave me to my meditation 
How am I to avert disaster with your constant meddling? 
Oh, I see. This is but another test 
The Void...beckons. 
If only...we had acted sooner. 
Engines screaming.
Mayday! Mayday!
Holla back.
Loud and clear.
I got my ears on.
Call the ball.
Yeah?
Receiving.
Roger that.
Done and done!
Can do.
In bound!
That's fine.
I got this!
Fine...
Engaging.
Right.
No problem!
Weapons hot!
Confirmed.
Turbines to full.
Rolling thunder.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Screamin' fury.
This could get messy!
They ain't gettin' far.
Apocalypse...now!
Targets acquired!
I think we oughta regroup.
Stealth mode engaged.
We ain't got all day.
I'm burning fuel here, smart guy.
This is the 'Give-em-hell-o-copter'!
What is with you monkeys in command?
Thanks for the...props.
You can only tie the record for low flight.
In space, everyone can hear me scream... (pause) ...cause I'm the Banshee, get it?
Today's in-flight movie will be Ghost Academy: The Musical, starring Zec Afron and Corbin Green.
Please turn off all cell phones, gauss rifles, EMPs, psionic waveform emitters, and plasma-based perdition flamethrowers. Thanks, and have a great flight!
What's the vector, Victor? Give me the clearance, Clarence.
Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit StimPacks...
Anyone else know how to fly this thing? No? I'll wing it...
Who called in the fleet?
It's a trap!
Abandon ship!
What is it?
Well?
You hailed?
Patching you through.
Yes, commander?
Oh really?
Course laid in.
Engage.
Acknowledged.
Yes sir.
Squadron en route.
Okay.
Will do.
Whatever that means...
Take it slow.
Roger!
I'm on it.
Yes commander...
En route!
Weapons charged and ready!
Commencing bombardment.
Take no prisoners!
Ah...how exciting!
Full attack! All weapons!
Cauterise the area.
Let's go this way really, really fast! If something gets in our way, shoot it!
We are running low on synergy...
This battlecruiser shoots, it destroys, but wait! It does more...
Let's hurry up and finish this attack, it's raid night...
What's with all these blinky lights?
Flying this low always makes me nervous.
Do svidaniya. Don't get any on ya!
I've lost my hat! Swing around, we'll pick it up.
We're going down. Stay with the ship. I'm out! Where's my escape pod?
The Yamato is loaded and so am I...
I'm seeing double! Shoot them both!
Ah, it's happy hour. Wonderful!
What do you mean we're out of olives?!
I have an announcement! I am drunk!
Don't panic, just grab ahold of the nearest crew member! Oh, sorry dear...
Systems go, Cyclone ready for action!
Optics online, let's go kill something!
Eject!
Takin' some fire here!
Enemy contact!
You got coordinates or what?
Show me who you wanna die.
This oughta be good.
Channel's clear boss.
Cyclone receiving.
Got a target in mind?
Comm's open.
Moving into position.
Nothing will stop me!
I getcha.
Cyclone en route.
In gear.
Oh, i'll get there.
Adjusting for new coordinates.
Target locked.
And... here... we... go.
I'm going in.
Oh, yeah. I see em!'
Let's stirr up some trouble.
Typhoon missiles locked.
Say goodnight!
This one's going down!
It's a cyclone, not a cyclops, alright? I don't care that it has one eye!
Oh this will drive circles round a diamondback. I guarantee it.
Ah, Im kinda outta jokes man. I'm not really a jokey kind of guy.
Gonna just keep poking me huh? Ugh, can we get back to fighting? I'm actually good at that!
Ghost reporting.
It's getting too hot!
You sure about that?
Out with it!
Give me the sitrep.
Come again?
Go...
Solo operative, right?
Copy that...
Nothing to it.
You're on.
Deploying...
Will do.
I'm on it.
Sounds like a plan.
Confirmed.
Roger.
Okay...
Target in my sights.
Paint the target. 
Never know what hit them.
You know what I like.
Well color me happy.
Now that's an ass-whooping.
All too easy.
Johnny number five, is not alive. 
Power down. 
Boo!
Nucular launch detected...
You call down the thunder...
...now deal with it!
Almost counts in horseshoes AND nuclear strikes!
I think the female ghosts have nicer equipment.
Did you see that? (pause) Exactly...
Pain don't hurt... (painful grunt)
Today's forecast is...extra bomby, slight chance of mushroom clouds.
I see live people. (two shots are heard) I see dead people.
Whenever I see a world untouched by war, a world of innocence, a world of lush forests and clear rivers. (pause) I really just wanna nuke the crap out of it!
You have something on your face. (gunshot) Got it.
I'll paint the town...dead.
Feeling lucky, punk?
We all got it coming, kid.
Make my day.
I know what you're thinkin'...
Never say die...
Ghost reporting.
Hostile contact.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Say again?
Confirm that last?
I'm reading you.
Status report.
Repeat last transmission.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Affirmative.
Orders received.
Understood.
Copy that.
On the move.
Target acquired.
Shutting it down.
Agent in motion.
Executing.
Commencing operations.
Roger.
On it.
Like a ghost in the fog.
Lock and load.
This one's mine.
Engaging hostiles.
Weapons free.
Got eyes on the enemy.
I'm taking the shot.
Pulling the trigger.
EMP deployed.
I like to think of myself as...the nuclear option.
I don't have better equipment. I'm just plain better.
Have we met? My memory is...not the best.
War. War changes every so often.
Know what I like about nukes? One shot, so many kills.
I used to forget things on occasion. Occasions scheduled by my wrangler.
It's E-M-P. What kind of idiot calls it an 'emp'?
Ghosts have a very particular set of skills. We will find you, and we will nuke your base.
You think your college years were stressful? Ghost academy classes are held next to a nuclear missile silo.
If you ever find yourself trying to track a cloaked ghost, just remember we have a telltale shimmer. Or just bring some detection.
Ever hear the one about the mind wiped ghost? I'd tell it to you, but I forgot how it ends.
Rumor has it Nova's on the battlefield. If you ask me, the chances of that being true are about one in a hundred.
I just want to say it's a pleasure working with you. Normally I can't stop hearing people's thoughts, so I'm enjoying the quiet.
Not enough energy.
So...you can kill a ghost. 
Hellbat, comin' through!
Talk to me.
Gettin' fired up here boss.
What's the story?
I hear you.
Let's set sum on fire.
Hot footin' it out there.
Hell yeah.
Here we go.
Word.
Done and done.
In motion.
Can't wait.
Let's give 'em hell.
Face napalm.
Burn baby, burn.
Toasty.
Lookin' forward to this.
Smoke 'em.
Flame on.
(Whistles) This thing had to set them back a pretty penny.
Transform and roll out.
I just wanna watch the world burn.
We ain't got no water. Just let the mother(beep)er burn.
Flame retardant? Well, you're half right.
To be honest, I don't cook, so much as I burn things.
You be grillin' while I be chillin'.
Hell ain't other people. It's me.
(Beep) the tires, let's light some fires.
The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as...twice as...wait...what's twice divided by half?
Ready to raise some hell!
Uhh... I'm in a heap of trouble!
Talk to me, boss!
Daylight's burnin'!
Are you ready for this?
Where's the hot action?
Light it up!
I'm waitin' on ya.
Burnin' rubber!
HELL yeah!
Let's do this!
Word...
Is that it?
Sound's sweet!
I'm goin' in!
Pedal to the metal!
Right on!
Absolutely!
All day long!
Sssmokin'!
Like a bat out of...ah, forget it...
Zerg. They're what's for dinner.
I'm burning up the road like a big dog in heat!
I am Speed. Ka-Chow!
Yes, in fact, I do own the road!
Off road? Hell, I do my best work off world.
Suspension is an integral part of any vehicle, but this one requires suspension of disbelief. (pause) Get it?
Wooh boy! I'm hotter than a June bug riding bareback on the hind leg of a jack rabbit with his tail on fire!
Gotta problem with alien races? Seriously, just anticipate the terrain, you'll win every time.
Put THAT in your tailpipe and smoke it!
Ain't fallin' for no banana in my tailpipe.
Liberation is at hand.
Reporting for action.
Standing by.
We have you on-screen.
Need something liberated?
Yes sir?
Flight plan is locked.
Incoming orders.
Got freedom?
How can we help?
We read you.
Attention.
Ah, Commander.
Full speed.
Of course.
As you say.
Easy.
Initiating.
Course set.
Unleash hell.
That one first.
Weapons free.
With pleasure Commander.
Battle stations.
It's liberation time.
Target confirmed.
Fire all missile clusters.
This vehicle is top of the line you know. The pinnacle of terran engineering. (beeping sound). Ignore that. I don't know what that is.
We come, not as conquerors, but as liberators, to return freedom to the people.
(Over blast sounds) Here's freedom! And here's some freedom for you! Mamma's got a whole lot of freedom!
If there's a piece of ground you want secure, my liberator can handle it. Anywhere around it you're kinda on your own.
We've learnt a lot about transforming vehicles since the viking. Hell, I've only had one crewman snap his spine this week.
Don't tell anyone, but I once piloted a conservator. Yeah. But it was in college so...you know...doesn't count.
I'm a strong believer in personal liberty. That everyone has the personal liberty to do precisely as they are told. Or be put to death. (evil laughter followed by a sigh)
Wow. Liberator to dictator in five seconds. That's gotta be some kinda record.
By the way, freedom is not free, okay? Freedom costs a buck o' five. Everyone knows that.
Let's have a blast!
KABOOM, baby!
Ohhh, it's on.
It's go time!
It's about to get heavy.
I'm in a world of hurt!
Just say when...
Go on...
Say the word, baby...
Time's a wastin'...
Don't leave me hanging!
Gotta WHOLE lotta love!
Ohhh, it's on.
Believe it.
I'm all about that.
Let's do this.
It's go time.
It's about to get heavy.
First round's on me.
Got it.
Sure.
Sure thing.
Why not?
Of course.
Blow them all to hell!
Sucks to be you!
Let's have a blast!
Say goodnight!
Blastin' time!
Frag 'em!
Diggin' in! 
Back in action! 
What the hell are smithereens, anyway?
Yeah, I got all five fingers! Three on this hand, two on the other one!
Baby...you really light my fuse (weapon fires) Whoops! (distant explosion heard) DAMN! Premature Detonation!
Baby, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together...
What's your sign, baby? Mine's explosive!
I'm sooo sexy. I sometimes romance myself.
Actually, that IS a grenade in my pants.
Where's the love?
Damn, I was good! 
You want a piece of me, boy?
Armed and ready!
Go, go, go!
This better be good...
We could use some help here!
Armed and ready!
By the numbers, boys.
Bring it!
Medic!
Been waitin' on you.
Who wants some?!
This better be good...
You gonna give me orders?
Roger that!
Why not?
That's fine.
I feel ya.
Got it.
Orders received.
Aye aye, sir!
Lookin' forward to it.
Boo ya!
Gangway, comin' through!
Affirmative.
Keep your shirt on, Sparky.
Sure thing!
Outstanding!
You got it!
Of course!
Yes sir!
Sure!
Ten-four.
Go go go!
Will do.
I'm on it!
Get some!
Bring it!
How's that for whoop-ass?
Let's rock!
Rawr!
Gonna get me some!
Let's do this!
Die die die!
Man... STILL stuck in this chickensh*t outfit...
You ever notice that nobody ever comes back to the barracks?
How do you take a leak in this damn suit?
Kiss my ass!
Whatever I do, they keep bringin' me back in!
This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!
I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum...
And I'm all outta...ugh, forget it.
The only thing you should feel when you shoot someone...is the recoil.
Man, am I just being paranoid or is that medic following me?!
This one time, at boot camp...
AAACHOO!! (Splat) Can't see a damn thing... (motor starts, windshield wiper sounds) Ah, much better.
Excuse me, I-I gotta burp...
Thank you, sir! May I have another!
Mother? 
Ready for dust-off.
Somebody get me out of this mess!
Ready for pick up?
Picking up or dropping off...
Where's the emergency?
Talk to me.
Waitin' on you.
Life flights here.
Now what?
Heading out.
Will do, command.
I heard that.

Hurry up! What are you missing a leg or some... (awkwardly) oh...
Attention passengers, the local time...doesn't matter since you'll be dead soon anyway.
WE'RE HIT!!! WE'RE HIT!!! WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!! WE'RE...haha! Just kidding! Should've seen the looks on your faces!

Got something for me to kill?
All right.

Done.
Fair enough.
Agreed.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, that's all?
Oh yeah, baby!
On the way.
Nothing I can't handle.
Let's do this!
Here comes the pain!
GERONIMO!
Gonna' have me some fun.
Hit and RUN!
It's on now!
Whole lot a' pain!
The life of a reaper man is always intense.
Damn it, I'm out of stims.
These jets are burning my ass!
I ain't got time to bleed.
You can't get it cheaper, call the reaper.
I'm bringing the pain, and the pizza in 30 minutes or it's free.
I make dead people.
I'm goin' commando.
To Tarsonis and beyond!
I thought I was signing up to be a repo man. Imagine my surprise.
This is ground control to Major Tom.
I like you. That's why I'm gonna kill you last.

You want us up there, call a dropship.
Don't like being caged...

What, you run out of marines?
This is your plan!?
This is crazy!
Oh that's just great...
(buzzing fly, splat) Gotcha! (SCV computer's voice) Self-destruct in five...four...three... (pilot) Uh-oh...
I can fix anything! (malfunctioning sounds) If this dang thing holds together...

Say...ya got a reeeaaal pretty mouth...
Oh, my cousin Lester saw a zergling, once...
On the CB, they call me Big Drill! (drill sounds)

My cow died last night, so I don't need your bull.
That's a negatory. It's blocked.
I can't build here.
There's something in the way
This Sucks.
Fueled up, ready to go!
Ready to roll out!
I'm in deep!
Give us your best shot!
What's our target?
Go ahead.
What's that?
Laaay it on me!
Got no patience for sittin' around!
Need something blowed up?
Speak up!
Oh, IT'S ON!!!
Rollin' out!
On my way!
Move it!
Rock and roll!
Rock on!
I never tread lightly...
Can do!
Yessir!
Heavy metal.
Let's roll!
I'll give it my best shot!
Definitely.
It's on me!

Pound em' flat!
This'll be a blast!
It's BOOM time!
Collateral is my favorite kind of damage!
Got em' in my sights
Dropping the hammer
Why don't you walk about thirty yards out and stand still for me?
I love the smell of burning wreckage in the morning!
I don't have to shoot ya. I can just run you over!
Hehe, man, I just LOVE blowin' things up!
Let me hear your guns, boy. (distant cannon fire)
Why can't I quit you, siege tank?
And here it is, a long drive up the fairway, he takes the shot and... (fires cannon) WHOA!! IT'S IN THE HOLE!! IT'S IN THE HOLE!!!!
Nothing like getting tanked with your buddies!
It's WAY past time I dispensed some indiscriminate justice!
If the guns are churnin', your ass is burnin'! If the guns are blazin', your ass is... (gears grind) ...a raisin. I don't know, what do you want from me?
Thor is here.
Your forces are under attack.
Ja! Come and fight me!
Fix me up, will ya?
Hit me!
I hear you!
I am here, click me!
Hear the thunder!
I'm heavy metal!
Got something for me?
Get me back into the fight!
I'm wasting away here!
Can do.
Now, now, now!
No problem.
All over it.
Stick around.
I'll be back.
Let's go!
Watch this.
OK, baby.

Ohh, it's on!
Dropping the hammer.
It's over you idiots!
Hammer of the gods!
Eat hot lead!
Don't waste my time!
Sue me, dickhead!
I am the destroyer!
I could aim, but with this thing, I don't have to.
What happened to you commander? They got you pushing too many pencils?
I am a thunder god!
And I hurl thunderbolts!
Eawarghhhhh!!!
(Lowered voice) Quiet... I'm trying to (now yelling) sneak up on them!
Thunder and lightning, this is crazy!
I am rated T for Thor.
If someone asks me if I am really a god, I'll say yes!
If someone asks me I ever killed any zerg, I'll say yes, but they were all bad!
What is best: to crush the zerg, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of the protoss.
Hahaha, good as new!
Just what I needed.
I'm on fire. No, really!
Hurry up and fix me you idiot!
Ragnarok, baby! 
Ready to plunder.
Can't hold them alone!
Fight or flight? Yeah right.

Get me outta here!

What's on your mind?
Go on.
What's the plan?
Mhm... mhm... What?
At the ready!
I'm waiting!
Of course.
I like it.
How devious.
My pleasure.
Excellent.
On the move.
Victory is ours!.
Unleash the hounds!
Heh, I like the way you think.
Oh goodie!
Gladly!
Railguns at the ready!
Bring a shovel for the burial.
Crush them!
Haaah... the open road, wind in my hair, universal domination.
Yes, in fact, I do own the road.
Not all who wander are lost... some of us are drunk.
I completely respect your opinion, as long as you keep it to yourself.
I don't suffer from insanity... I enjoy it.
My reputation precedes me. Otherwise I'd be late to all my appointments.
Ah, the open skies, wind at my back, warm sun on my... wait, where the hell am I?!
Have you no shame? Good, neither do I.
I'm a compulsive liar. It's true, I swear it!
Revenge is a dish best served cold... to someone who's already dead, because you killed him, out of revenge.
Damn the luck! 
Need a light?
Mmmm...My goose is getting cooked!
Ready to roast!
Fight fire with fire.
Say the word.
You got my attention.
Fueled up!
Ready to fry.
Mmmm... Let's get cookin'!
Well done.
Smokin'!
Let's do this.
Barbeque time.
Humm... scorched earth.
Smells like... victory.
FLAME ON!
Let's burn!
It's about damn time!
Ashes to ashes.
Fired up.
Cremate 'em.
They do not know who they are (flame burst) with!
Into the pill box. 
Out of the frying pan. 
I'm not just some flash in a pants you know.
Slow down, where's the fire? (flame burst) Nevermind.
How'd you want your Zerg, original, or extra crispy?
Where there's smoke (flame burst) there's me.
Burninating the countryside.
I'm always hot... and bothered.
I'm gonna flip you over and make sure you're done on the other side.
Zerg... they plump when you cook 'em.
We're grillin' and killin'
Stop, drop and roll... always makes me laugh.
Stop, drop and DIE.
Ahh... turns out I hate the smell of napalm in the morning.
Pork fat rules!

This is gonna hurt.

Patient prognosis is dead!
Ooh. Looks like that hurts. Next!
Here's some lotion, a comb, and a blowtorch. Good luck!
For the last time, this is NOT a strip-o-gram!
That's the worst infestation I've ever seen! Next time, stay away from the cantina.
There's a protoss here who needs mouth-to-mou - ooh... well... mouth to... something.
If I do it wrong, it'll hurt a little. If I do it right, it'll hurt a lot.
Dammit, I'm a medic not a doctor! (pause) ...oh.
Call me when the swelling goes down, on second thought, just call me.
Can I see your insurance card? Oh, I'm sorry, this was a pre-existing condition.
Operation complete! Now where did I leave my watch?
Uhh I got leftovers. I don't even know where these go!
Congratulations! You're my first patient...ever!

Commander, you and me are about to have words.

Oh no... 
This ain't good... 
Here's the beef!
This ain't no bull! I'm in trouble!
Got zerg on my left flank.
Milked up and good to go.
Are you gonna give me udders?
This codpiece gives me tenderloins.
The name's T-bone. Chuck T-bone.
You will call me Sir... Loin.
Nice rack... ain't it.
Call me leather neck.
What's up beef jerky?
Beefy!
I'll hoof it from here.
Don't have a cow, man.
Give me something to chew.
Don't prod me, boy.
Steer me this way.
You're the Matador.
MOOve!
Stop staring on me like I'm some piece of meat.
Head 'um up, move 'em out
MOOOOve out!
COWABUNGA!!!
Bullseye!

Staaaampede!
He called my momma a cow!
You mess with the bull, you get the horns.
So my astrologer says that I'm stubborn and dependable, and blessed with bullish, pun intended, steadiness. She also said my lottery numbers were 4, 29, 19, 78. I haven't won yet!
My favorite band? Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain and the Jonas Brothers, of course!
You wanna piece of me, boy?
You wanna piece of MEAT, boy?
Well, good! I got flank, shank, rib eye and brisket - take a pick.
It's been long time since I had good milking.
How I get out of this bull sh*moo* outfit?!

Another slow day in this line of work.
I've made a few enemies over the years. But nothing like this.
I'd read their minds, except there's just not enough going on in there.
You might say I have a special talent...for ending up in the middle of bad situations.
Here in the Dominion, the emperors change, but the soldiers stay the same.
It's fitting that they call us ghosts, you know. After we join, we leave our old lives behind. Families, friends, they all just...disappear.
At one point all I wanted was to forget my past. I finished my training and my memories were wiped clean. Got 'em back a few years later. Long story.
The sector has problems. And I have solutions.
You're not going to become a problem, are you?
Trust me, I've got enough attitude for the both of us.
You're lucky I still have a neural inhibitor.
Let's make it count.
I'm getting buried here!
This don't look good.

I got it, hotshot.
Yeah yeah I'm doin' it.
Oh that's just great.
Hey, leave some for me.
Oh it's payback time.
I'll keep 'em at arm's length. (laugh)
How'd you like that?
Hey, wanna arm wrestle?
Hey, wanna hear the sound of one hand clappin'? (metallic thud)
Present... arm!
I got your nutcracker right here. (nutcracking sound)
Havin' a claw for a hand is great, so as long as you don't scratch.

There ain't no unkickable ass when you got the Odin.
(Laughter) And I will strike down upon thee, with great vengeance and furious anger.
Damn, I thought gods were immortal. 
Killin' time!
Gonna be a ghost for real.
You got me into this. Get me out!
You askin', or tellin'?
Open your mind.
I know it before you see it.
Out with it.
Talk is cheap.
Convince me.
What's crackin'?
Let's do this.
Let's just see about that.
Damn straight.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Irie.
I do, what I wanna do.
Bad mojo on the way.
Extinguish the flame.
Gonna do it real quiet.
Bleed 'em slow.
Trust ain't easy to come by.
Fear is my greatest weapon.
You're dead, and you don't even know it.
I ain't afraid of no ghost.
Who you gonna call?
(laughter)
My gun be jammin'!
Watch the voodoo that I do.
Don't be bringing me back. 
I'm out!
Ooh... damn.
Hyperion: Online and prepped
We’re under heavy fire here!
Contain that hull breach!
Hyperion Actual.
Radio Check, over.
Communications online.
Awaiting Confirmation.
Horner responding.
Receiving transmission.
Course Laid in.
Nice and easy
Make it so.
Bring us around.
Locked in.
Confirmed.
Easy thrusters.
Keep your eyes open.
Systems are go.
Focus all batteries.
The outcome is not in question.
Let’s show them what this boat can do.
All hands to battle stations.
Get aggressive, Raiders.
We’re going hot!
It’s nothing personal.
Hostiles confirmed and locked.
Agh, is this thing working?
Swann, I think we lost the comm station.
Is anyone there?
Mira, is that you?
I swear, I’ll never play cards again
Bloody pirates
Hyperion may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts.
I’d place the odds of successfully navigating this asteroid field at 3720… to 1.
Hit that bulls-eye and the dominos will fall like a house of cards, Checkmate
Hyperion’s a good ship, wait till you see her after I blow out her exhaust.
My ship! UGH! 
Rig startup complete.
Let's get cracking.
Not doing so hot over here, boss!
Hey, things are getting real, real fast here!
Speak up, boss.
I read ya.
Whatcha need, man?
Hmm?
Got some work for me?
Finally, some work orders.
Yo.
What's up tough guy?
Alrighty, I'm moving.
Got it.
Oh, I see it.
Book'n and hook'n.
Hey, you're the boss.
Site's this way.
Heading that way.
No problemo.
No skin off my back.
This guy's in for a shock.
Let's crack 'em a part.
Sizzlin' time!
Love this part.
(Laugh)
Sparking up.
Arc's alight.
Ten thousand volts o' pain.
That one, huh?
You plan on spitting it out any time soon? I'm on the clock.
So what, I'm in the army now? Man, you guys are just taking everyone, huh?
Alright. Space mining 101. They call this badboy an ARC gun. You point it an asteroid, squeeze the trigger, and BLAM, nothing but meteors.
I figure if it can crack open an asteroid, it can damn sure crack open a zerg, right?
If you think you need to puke while you're in deep space, don't. Seriously, it goes nowhere, and yet.... everywhere. It's all kinds of messed up.
Oh and to be clear, this whole leap on a guy and shock 'em to death thing is DEFINATELY against the safety protocols. Just sayin'.
You drill, you drop the nuke, and you leave. In that order.
Hey! Don't push me around like I'm one of your military men. I'm a miner, not a major.
I got real work to do, commander. Can't just sit here jabbering all day.
Ugh. 
Man that hurts. 
Metamorphosis completed.
Orders?
Yours to command.
Engaging.
Kill them all, let Kerrigan sort them out.
Metamorphosis completed.
Orders?
Yours to command.
Engaging.
It will be done.
Kill them all, let Kerrigan sort them out.
I'm looking for a cat. Means the world to me!
I serve.
Your will?
Lead me.
Yes.
Gladly!
Might have to call in sick today. Feeling a little touch of something.
Aghh What's this?!...(pause) I don't know.
Assimilation successful.
Your command?
Awaiting directive.
For the Swarm!
I obey.
Service complete. 
These are dark times
We have met the enemy.
Reinforcements now!
Speak freely
There is no need for formality
I hear you
Keep your mind clear
You need something?
Our victory is assured!
Forward!
The end is at hand.
A sound decision.
Yes, I see.
Done!
Move quickly!
Show me what you're worth.
Strike swiftly.
There will be no end to your suffering.
I will break you
Is this all you have.
No hesitation.
I expect nothing less.
Ow, my eyes are burning!
I bring a whole new meaning to zerg Russian.
Let's recap. I was betrayed and killed, shot into space, captured by the zerg, resurrected and infested, cured, given to Moebius to research the protoss cure, and was instead experimented on as the cure slowly failed. Everyone up to speed? Good.
Funny, as a child I loved horror stories. Now I'm in one.
Those about to die, I salute you.
Some days I miss vodka. Like today for example
Being infested isn't all bad. These spiky things are great for scratching your back
I fight to win. For me. For me.
The nuclear wessels are in Alameda
До свидания... Not again 
I live.
Many enemies.
So much essence
There is no need for formality
I listen.
I will collect.
All things change.
growls
I will take essence.
Change will come.
I will change.
Forward!
Yes.
I follow.
I go.
Watchful.
More essence.
Essence flows. I follow.
(growl)
Strike swiftly.
Their essence will be mine!.
Essence!
I take their essence!
Kill!
Change drives me.
I grow.
I do not talk.
The terrans' tools. So many tools.
I have not evolved a new arm. Why?
Your essence looks delicious.
All these teeth. I will evolve a tooth brush.
(growl) Too much talk! Take essence. Change.
I change. I grow. I live a thousand life times. And I look pretty good!
More... essence. 
Change... more... 
How may I serve?
They are attacking me!
The protoss seek my death!
Guide my brood!
I am Niadra!
Our time has come!
We yearn for the kill!
I hear!
My queen?
This vessel will burn!
The hunt continues!
We obey!
Without question!
As you desire!
For the Swarm!
Yes, my queen.
Kill the protoss!
None survive!
Die!
I've got you now!
(shout)
There is nowhere to run!
I see you!
It is difficult to follow your commands when you do not give me any!
Can I please kill more protoss now?
They have so much technology, yet none of it will save them from the Swarm!
Why would the protoss gather so many creatures when they have no mouths to eat them with?
Spawn a brood and destroy the protoss. Simple to learn, yet difficult to master.
This is all so new to me. Does everyone have a voice in their head telling them what to do?
Things seemed so easy when I was a larva. Now it's all 'slay the protoss' this and 'evolve your brood' that! Huh, I'll tell you what, I'll never treat my larva this way!
Here I come, ready or not.
Now I'm mad.
Wow. What a surprise.
Wanna play?
Careful what you ask for.
Cat got your tongue?
Who asked you?!
Don't get in my way.
This world is mine.
No more games.
The evolution continues.
So predictable.
The Swarm will consume all.
The outcome is not in question.
No one gets a free pass.
Let's have some fun.
I don't take prisoners.
How stimulating.
The past is dead and buried.
Don't get yourself into something you can't get out of.
Yeah, I'm still the Queen Bitch of the Universe.
You pig!
I'm all creeped out.
Come closer. Don't be afraid, I'll be gentle...(screech)
I like you. That's why I'm going to kill you last.
Nice planet. I'll take it.
You're even more desperate than I thought.
I'm full of surprises... 
Don't write me off just yet. 
I'm still here
I'm back!
Let's try that again.
Hostiles engaging.
Under heavy fire here!
What is it?
This is Kerrigan.
Yeah, I hear you
Say again?
Ready for action.
Safety's off.
The Swarm hungers.
Pushing ahead.
Covering ground.
Right.
Work to be done.
I gotcha!
Heading out.
Sweeping.
I see 'em.
You're not getting away.
Time for some payback.
Press the attack.
In my sights.
Gotcha.
Bring 'em down!
One woman army.
Hold still.
Target identified.
Got one.
I remember so little from before.
The Dominion won't get away with this.
Still easily amused, I see.
Keep clicking! I'm reloading.
I forgot how tight these suits are!
Ugh, you're such a pig!
I do read minds, you know.
You're thinking of the number four. At least, now you are!
I'd kill for a working cloaking device. Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Can't quit...now! 
It's not over yet! 
Did you miss me?
Hmm, can't get rid of me that easy!
I will not be stopped!
We have met the enemy in combat.
What is it now?
Out with it.
Yes?
You have my attention.
Speak quickly.
Who asked you?
The Swarm hungers.
Push ahead.
The Swarm never rests.
There's not much time.
Let's get this over with.
This world is mine.
Get going!
Nothing stands in my way.
No escape.
This one's mine.
You'll regret that.
Press the attack.
Come fight me.
This ends now.
Just die!
Spare no one!
Take no prisoners.
I will have my vengeance.
You didn't think the Swarm was gone forever, did you?
Hell hath no fury like a woman swarmed.
It's not easy being queen.
I like you. That's why I'm going to kill you last.
It's evolution, baby!
Be quiet. I'm brooding.
Did your heart just skip a beat?
(sigh) So many worlds to conquer. So little time.
This is not the end! 
I'll see you again! 
We are unending
Your efforts are futile.
I am beyond death.
I return.
Your queen is under attack!
The Swarm has met the enemy.
What is it this time?
Speak.
Yes?
Your queen listens.
It is time.
Retribution will be mine.
Mengsk will suffer.
I am The Swarm.
Our conquest continues.
We adapt.
Make your peace
This world is mine.
Boldly.
The Swarm conquers all.
We are without limit.
No time like the present.
Death awaits you.
We consume all.
You're in my way.
Slay them all.
You forced my hand.
Feel the wrath of the Swarm.
No mercy.
I sense your fear.
You're trying my patience.
The Swarm is the instrument of my will..
I have evolved beyond the Queen of Blades
I always did look better in purple!
Revenge? I'm positively aglow about it!
I think I'll wing it from here!
You should get to know my primal side! (shriek)
Did your heart just skip a beat?
You might want to get that checked!
I will not be defeated! 
I delay the inevitable! 
Meaningless... 
I will not be stopped
The fight begins
What is it, already?
Speak.
Yes?
Your queen listens.
You have my attention.
Explain yourself.
Make it quick.
I am the Swarm.
Boldly.
No time like the present.
My search continues...
I've come this far.
I need answers.
You're in my way...
No mercy.
Death awaits you!
I sense your fear.
Slay them all!
This is what you deserve.
Whatever it takes.
My true enemy waits in the darkness.
Amon and his hybrid will die.
This is the true war... the one that could end everything.
I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis.
Are you trying to annoy me?
Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
So much that happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years...
This isn't over...
I am infinite.
I strike at the enemy!
What is it you require?
Speak to me.
My destiny manifests.
Infinity unravels before me.
A new age will dawn.
Amon shall meet his end.
I can see... countless universes.
The final stand begins now.
I am called.
I cannot delay.
This is my burden to bear.
I will not fail.
It shall be.
My power is vast.
You will not decide our fate!
Begone.
Your time has ended.
I am unstoppable.
I sense their fear...
All shall be one with the light!
So long as Amon lives, we are in peril.
I will bring peace to the cosmos.
So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
I am the culmination of prophecy.
I can see everything now...
The thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
Alone' we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
That bond must sustain us now.
This was not to be...
The Swarm prevails.
I am eternal.
The Brood is under attack.
You think You can defeat me?
What are your commands?
I listen.
We are ready to kill.
The Swarm hungers.
We move.
Agreed.
The fittest shall survive.
Your bidding.
This world shall fall.
Our vengeance will be complete.
Without question.
You can not escape the Swarm!
Our pray nears.
We devour.
The Swarm comes for You!
Feel the fury of the Swarm!
I am Your ????
Die!
Death from above!
Deploy ???? now!
My brood rains from the skies!
The Swarm descends!
My brood arrives!
From the skies we come! 
I am not insterested in the possibilities of defeat, they do not exist!
Shouldn't You be spawning more overlords?
Feeble creature.
One day I shall rule the Swarm!
And on that day, You die first!
I fear ????????
I'm a killer queen!
The Swarm will never die! 
You can not kill me! 
PREPARE for DEATH.
A TEMPORARY setback.
Surrender to DESPAIR.
Still you cling to HOPE.
Do you not see the futility?
Why PERSIST?
DEATH comes to you.
NONE shall stand.
Life is FORFEIT.
THIS is the end.
OBLIVION for all.
DOOM.
No REPRIEVE.
Resistance is FOOLISH.
All resistance will be ERADICATED.
I SHALL return. 
Your efforts are wasted... 
I shall NOT end.
Merely a temporary setback.
Your doom is only delayed.
You cannot destroy me. I shall rise again.
I go to gather my strength.
Enjoy your fleeting victory. This is not over.
